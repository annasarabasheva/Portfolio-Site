            <p>
                I am a passionate Industrial Engineering student at RWTH Aachen University with a focus on Mechanical Engineering. 
                I have a strong foundation in engineering principles and am particularly interested in the integration of 
                natural sciences with engineering and economics. Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring new technologies and 
                applying my skills to real-world problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to contribute to innovative solutions in the field of industrial engineering and technology while 
                constantly growing and improving my skill set. I'm always eager to learn new things and take on challenges that 
                allow me to expand my knowledge and experience.
            </p>
