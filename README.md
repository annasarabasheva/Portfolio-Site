# 📂 Portfolio-Site

Welcome to my **Porfolio Project** repository! This project showcases the skills, experience, and projects of a client in a visually appealing and interactive manner. While this portfolio is not my personal portfolio, I created it as a practice project to enhance my web development skills. 

The site is built with **React.js** and is designed to provide a seamless experience when browsing the client's personal information and technical expertise. This project served as a valuable opportunity to improve my understanding of React, UI/UX design, and responsive web development.

Feel free to explore the project and the technologies used to build it by clicking following link:
